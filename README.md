Aruboy Apollo 11 Animation
===

This as an animation I really wanted to build quickly before the Apollo 11 50th anniversary. It features a moon bitmap and a 'beacon' on Mare Tranquility, the location of Apollo 11's landing. The [Arduboy] (https://arduboy.com/) features an iconic design and can fit easily in a 'conference badge lanyard', which is exactly what I did to show of my nerd at Kennedy Space Center.

Installing
======

The 'moon_badge' sketch folder holds all of the code, so open the 'moon_badge.ino' in the Arduino IDE.

Install the dependencies for this project. In the Arduino IDE, Go to `Tools > Manage Libraries` and install:
    Arduboy2

Can't Connect to your Arduboy?

My Arduboy would not be detected over any port in the Arduino IDE. I found [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpB89NY2HeU) and tada! My Arduboy was working!
